Review Exercise 2 this will be 1hr 20 mins
================= (so we're done about 2:55 then tea break, then show-and-tell)

Build an app to retrieve user data from the API at
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users

Combine users with their todos and/or photos etc.
The available nested routes are:
    /posts/1/comments
    /albums/1/photos 
    /users/1/albums
    /users/1/todos
    /users/1/posts

Show a nice collection of a user's photos or a users 'completed' todos
- e.g. on the web page
- or use console.log and string interpolation

Handle exceptions (catch)
type-safe the Promise
use async/await

If you like, download the JSON and do it all offline (no fetch) or try NodeFetch (look it up)

Optional
========
Provide a way to parameterize which user to retrieve (i.e. ask in the web page)
How could you offer a filter (say photos by user or todos by complete)...


NB the API also permits fake delete, post and (real) filter - see the API documentation
